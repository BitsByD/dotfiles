# dotfiles

This is where I keep my handy dandy configs for various tools on Mac OS and Linux.

## Prerequisites

* None

## Instructions

```sh
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/dvhthomas/dotfiles
./dotfiles/setup-shell.sh
```

Probably want to open a new shell at this point and ensure that `zsh` is working as expected.

```sh
./dotfiles/install.sh
```
